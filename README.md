### Hi there! I'm Julia Luz ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Brazil. I'm working as Data Analyst since 2019.
I'm currently learning Python, R, SQL, Spark, Statistic.

## Analysis Steps Tips

1- Think about the story you are creating: What is my goal? What do I need to answer or test?
2- How my data is structured?
3- Import data
4- How to handle each variable?
5- What transformation do I need to do?

6- Create a data dictionary with all variables
7- At first calculate the basic metrics of mean, median, mode, asymmetry, and kurtosis
8- Think about how answering the main question with data: Do I need a histogram? Another metric or table?

#### Create a file with useful codes of your preferred programming language: Python, R, Julia, and update whenever you discover new commands. It will be your ally in the next analysis.
