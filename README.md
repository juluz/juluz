### Analysis Steps Tips

1- Think about the story you are creating: What is my goal? What do I need to answer or test? <br>
2- How my data is structured? <br>
3- Import data <br>
4- How to handle each variable? <br>
5- What transformation do I need to do? <br>

6- Create a data dictionary with all variables <br>
7- At first calculate the basic metrics of mean, median, mode, asymmetry, and kurtosis <br>
8- Think about how answering the main question with data: Do I need a histogram? Another metric or table? <br>

-  Create a file with useful codes of your preferred programming language: Python, R, Julia, and update whenever you discover new commands. It will be your ally in the next analysis.
